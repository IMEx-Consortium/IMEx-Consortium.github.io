# About IMEx

The IMEx consortium is an international collaboration between a group of major public interaction data providers who have agreed to share curation effort and:

*   Develop and work to a single set of curation rules when capturing data from both directly deposited interaction data or from publications in peer-reviewed journals
*   Capture full details of an interaction in a “deep” curation model
*   Perform a complete curation of all protein-protein interactions experimentally demonstrated within a publication
*   Make these interaction available in a single search interface on a common website
*   Provide the data in standards compliant download formats
*   Make all IMEx records freely accessible under the Creative Commons Attribution License

### IMEx defines three types of membership:

1. Active: IMEx partner commits to producing relevant numbers of records curated to IMEx standard and providing these via a PSICQUIC service.
1.  Observer: Prospective IMEx consortium member.
1.  Inactive: former IMEx partner who contributed to the establishment of the IMEx curation rules and/or have contributed data to the IMEx dataset.

### Data Availability

<p markdown="1">
All IMEx Consortium data is centralised in the IntAct database at the EMBL-EBI. Member databases curate into IntAct, then make some or all of the data available at their own websites. Currently, the entire IMEx dataset can be accessed via the ([//www.ebi.ac.uk/intact](IntAct website)) (Active) and the ([//mentha.uniroma2.it/](metha web portal)) (Active). Biological domain-specific resources such as MatrixDB and HPIDB, only import specific subsets of data back into their own resources.
</p>
<p markdown="1">
Data can be searched on the IMEx website ([IMEx website](//www.imexconsortium.org/home)) and downloaded in PSI-MI XML2.5 or MITAB format, enabling users to visualize the data in a wide range of tools such as Cytoscape and the R Bioconductor software suite. Species-specific PSI-MI XML2.5 and 3.0 and MITAB2.7 files can currently be accessed on ([//www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/downloads](www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/downloads)) (Active). Please be warned that this site contains legacy non-IMEx data from the DIP, IntAct, MINT and UniProtKB curation teams – a specific IMEx ftp site will be established later. All datasets will automatically increase with every release of the IntAct database.
