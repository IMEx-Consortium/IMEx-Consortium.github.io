# About IMEx

The IMEx consortium is an international collaboration between a group of major public interaction data providers who have agreed to share curation effort and:

*   Develop and work to a single set of curation rules when capturing data from both directly deposited interaction data or from publications in peer-reviewed journals
*   Capture full details of an interaction in a “deep” curation model
*   Perform a complete curation of all protein-protein interactions experimentally demonstrated within a publication
*   Make these interaction available in a single search interface on a common website
*   Provide the data in standards compliant download formats
*   Make all IMEx records freely accessible under the Creative Commons Attribution License

### IMEx defines three types of membership:

1. Active: IMEx partner commits to producing relevant numbers of records curated to IMEx standard and providing these via a PSICQUIC service.
1.  Observer: Prospective IMEx consortium member.
1.  Inactive: former IMEx partner who contributed to the establishment of the IMEx curation rules and/or have contributed data to the IMEx dataset.

### Data Availability

IMEx partners all produce their own separate resources, which range from all encompassing molecular interaction databases, such as are maintained by IntAct, MINT and DIP, organism-centric resources such as BioGrid or MPIDB or biological domain centric, such as MatrixDB. However additionally to this, they have committed to making records available, via a dedicated [PSICQUIC](http://code.google.com/p/psicquic/) webservice, which have been curated to IMEx rules and are available to the user as a single, non-redundant set of curated publications which can be searched at the IMEx website. The dataset will automatically increase with every release by a participating, member database. Data is made available in standards-compliant tab-deliminated and XML formats, enabling users to visualize the data in a wide range of tools such as Cytoscape and the R Bioconductor software. In the short term, data redundancy will be managed by ensuring that partners only contribute records from a selected list of journals (see below) or from direct submission by authors as part of the publication process. This will shortly be replaced by an internal data management system which will allow a much greater range of journal articles to be made available to the user
