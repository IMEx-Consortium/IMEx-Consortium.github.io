<h2><span>Curation</span> Requests</h2>
<p>Users may request the <span>curation</span> of specific papers not currently included in the <span>IMEx</span> data set. One of the <span>IMEx</span> databases will then annotate the paper (assuming the data within is of sufficient quality) and release the data as quickly as possible. If you wish to request <span>curation</span> of one or a set of papers, please <a href="../webforms/contact-us/index.html">Contact Us</a> with the full details and this will be arranged.</p>
<h2>Error reporting</h2>
<p>Should a user spot any error in any of the <span>IMEx</span> dataset, please do not hesitate to <a href="../webforms/contact-us/index.html">Contact Us</a> with the details and we will endeavor to correct the record.</p>
