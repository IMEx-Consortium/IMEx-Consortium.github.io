# Curation

## Curation Rules

The curation rules are explained in full in the Curation Manual. Individual databases may locally impose additional rules,Â  but these will be additional to and not break the agreed IMEx guidelines.

## Curation Requests

Users may request the curation of specific papers not currently included in the IMEx data set. One of the IMEx databases will then annotate the paper (assuming the data within is of sufficient quality) and release the data as quickly as possible. If you wish to request curation of one or a set of papers, please [Contact Us](../contact-us) with the full details and this will be arranged.

## Error reporting

Should a user spot any error in any of the IMEx dataset, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us](../contact-us) with the details and we will endeavor to correct the record.
